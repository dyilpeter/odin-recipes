        <h3>Description</h3>
        <p>A stew is a combination of solid food ingredients that have been cooked in liquid and served in the resultant gravy. A stew needs to have raw 
            ingredients added to the gravy. Ingredients in a stew can include any combination of vegetables and may include meat, especially tougher meats 
            suitable for slow-cooking, such as beef, pork, lamb, poultry, sausages, and seafood.</p>

        <h3>Ingredients</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>2 large Bell peppers</li>
            <li>1-3 Scotch bonnet peppers</li>
            <li>4 medium Plum tomatoes</li>
            <li>1 large onion</li>
            <li>3 cloves Garlic</li>
            <li>1/2 inch ginger</li>
            <li>1/4 cup Palm oil</li>
            <li>1/4 cup olive oil or vegetable oil</li>
            <li>2 tbsp tomato paste</li>
            <li>1 to 1Â½ cups beef stock I used the liquid from cooking the beef</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon Curry powder</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon dried thyme</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon chicken or beef bouillon</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Steps</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Trim off any excess fat from the meat. Rinse a couple of times 
                till the water runs clear.</li>
            <li>Place the beef in a large pot. Add the diced onion, bay leaf, 
                curry powder, rosemary, bouillon powder, and salt. Mix well, 
                cover, and leave to cook on medium heat for 10 minutes.</li>
            <li>Add the water stir and continue to cook on medium heat for 
                another 20 minutes or until the meat becomes tender. (Tougher meat cut will require a longer cooking time)</li>
            <li>When the meat is fully cooked use a sieve to separate the meat 
                from the stock. Reserve the stock.</li>
            <li>Blend the tomatoes, onion, bell peppers, scotch bonnet peppers, 
                garlic, tomato paste, and ginger, and set aside.</li>
            <li>In a large pot add the cooking oil on medium heat. Once the oil 
                is hot but not smoking, add the diced onions and cook for about 3 minutes.</li>
            <li>Add the blended pepper-tomato mixture stir, cover, and leave to 
                cook on medium heat for about 10 minutes, occasionally stirring 
                to prevent burning.</li>
            <li>Stir in the beef stock, thyme, curry powder, and bouillon, and 
                continue to cook for another 10 minutes on medium-low heat.</li>
            <li>Add the cooked beef, taste for salt, and adjust as needed. Cover 
                and leave to simmer on low heat for another 5 minutes or until the stew is thickened to your preference.</li>
            <li>Serve with white rice and fried plantains. Garnish with parsley if 
                desired. Enjoy!</li>
